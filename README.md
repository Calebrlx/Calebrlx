# Hey there! I'm Caleb 🏂

Welcome to my slice of GitHub, a place where code meets chaos, sprinkled with a hint of audacity. I’m the guy who thrives on risks, akin to a free ride down the icy slopes of Alyeska Resort, my chilly playground back in Eagle River, Alaska.

🌱 By day, I’m nurturing [Relix](https://relix.ai), an AI startup, with the ambition of a lawn that I once obsessively cared for. Who knew the transition from mowing lawns to molding neurons could be so... unpredictable?

👀 My journey has always been about taking the unbeaten path, sometimes leading to thriving lawns (literally), other times to thriving lines of code. And sometimes, it's a spectacular crash and burn. But hey, the ashes often have a story to tell, right?

💼 I have a knack for creating and... let’s say, 'experimenting' with businesses. The pace at which I juggle between them could give a circus clown a run for his money. It's all about seeing how swiftly I can build, innovate, and occasionally, send them tumbling down like a house of cards. All in good spirit!

🛠️ Though not a self-proclaimed professional, I believe in rolling up the sleeves and diving head-first into the enigmatic waters of the unknown. There's something about untangling the complex knots in coding and business ventures that keeps me on my toes. And sure, there’s a chance I might trip over the hurdles, but as they say, _"Viam inveniam aut faciam"_ (I will either find a way or make one).

🎢 Life's a wild ride, and I'm here for it, whether it's a smooth sail or a bumpy trail. Each day is a page of an unwritten book and heck, I'm just here scribbling my part, one misadventure at a time.

📫 Dive into my repositories, critique my codes, or drop a message if the chaos resonates with you. Let’s create, crash, learn, and laugh through this madcap journey of entrepreneurship and coding.
